| /arma3/steamapps/workshop/content/107410 | Steam workshop mods

For quickest startup but larger storage space, recommend saving the `/arma3` volume.
For a smaller storage space, add all the other volumes under `/arma3/` directory.


### Creator DLC
To use a Creator DLC the `STEAM_BRANCH` must be set to `creatordlc` and
then set `ARMA_CDLC` environment variable to the CDLC class name(s) [found in wiki](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Category:Arma_3:_CDLCs)
separated by `;`.

Example: `-e ARMA_CDLC=csla;gm;vn;ws`


### Steam workshop mods
The script will check for any workshop mod updates on startup and only download what is out of date.
Place the mod list html exported by the launcher anywhere in the `/arma3/` directory and add the path to
`WORKSHOP_MODS` environment variable to load.
The script will also to lowercase the workshop mod file paths as arma3 paths need to be case sensitive.

### Headless Clients
Launch n number of headless clients when `HEADLESS_CLIENTS` environment variable is set.
Profiles loaded for each headless client will be set to `${ARMA_PROFILE}-hc-${n}`.
For headless clients to connect, you must also have the following in your config cfg file:
```
headlessclients[] = {"127.0.0.1"};
localclient[] = {"127.0.0.1"};
```
