An Arma 3 Dedicated Server that can update arma and mods on startup.


### Creator DLC
To use a Creator DLC the `STEAM_BRANCH` must be set to `creatordlc` and
then set `ARMA_CDLC` the CDLC class name [found here](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Category:Arma_3:_CDLCs)
seperated by `;`.

Example: `ARMA_CDLC=csla;gm;vn;ws`
